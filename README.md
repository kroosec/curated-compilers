# About

This repository regroups resources (books, articles, talks...) about compilers construction and related topics (interpreters, parsing, VM's, JIT-compilers, programing languages theory, GC implementations etc,.)

Unlike awesome-* lists, my goal is to only add resources:
- That I've fully read (thus, I won't be adding SICP yet ;))
- And which I found to be of good quality (Concise explanation, challenging exercises, new ideas etc,.)

Propositions are welcome, but due to the two reasons cited above, it may take me some time to add them.

# Books
- [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/): This book is light on theory, but heavy on practice. At 200 pages, this is a quick read, and you can learn Go along the way (or use your favorite language) [to implement the Monkey language](https://github.com/kroosec/magot)

# Articles
- [Baby's First Garbage Collector](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/12/08/babys-first-garbage-collector/) A great introduction to implementing a mark-and-sweep Garbage Collector in C.
