# About

A collection of resources (books, articles, talks...) about programming
languages theory, compilers construction and other related topics
(interpreters, lexers/parsers, VM's, JIT-compilation, GC implementations etc,.)


Unlike awesome-* repositories, my goal is to only add resources:
- That I've fully read (thus, I won't be adding SICP yet ;))
- And which I found to be of good quality (Concise explanations, challenging
  problem sets, new ideas etc,.)


Propositions are welcome, but it may take me some time to add them if ever, due to the reasons cited above.

# Books
- [Writing an Interpreter in Go](https://interpreterbook.com/): This book is light on theory, but heavy on practice. At 200 pages, this is a quick read, and you can learn Go along the way (or use your favorite language) [to implement the Monkey language](https://github.com/kroosec/magot).

# Articles
- [Baby's First Garbage Collector](http://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2013/12/08/babys-first-garbage-collector/) A great introduction to implementing a mark-and-sweep Garbage Collector in C.
- [What To Know Before Debating Type Systems](https://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/01/09/an-old-article-i-wrote/)
  A well-written lengthy article about type systems.
